Extra description of UML

The Habit class is the main class and holds all the data and functions required for a habit. this includes a list of editable completions referenced by Date

Each habit also has set of days that it occurs on, using an DayOfWeek Enum class

Each Habit instance is uniquely identifiable with UUID by impenmenting the UniquelyIdentifiable Interface


All Habits are saved in a single container, the HabitSetList.

The HabitSetList instances are saved and loaded with the static class HabitFileIO. To perform operations on a specific habit
  it is selected with its unique UUID. This avoids any use of indexing by numbers, or passing of objects through activities.
  All that is passed around is a habits UUID, and then the static HabitFileIO class is used to save and load changes to HabitSet list
 
There are 3 activities. The main one is used to view all habits or habits by day (by default selecting the current day).
  clicking one of the listed habits takes you to the HabitViewActivity, where changes and completions can be added or removed.
  Also in the main activity you can select the Add habit button, which takes you to the AddHabitActivity. 
  This activity has all the required options to set up a recurring habit
